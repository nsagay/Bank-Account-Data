# Bank-Account-Data
This is a simple project using stored procedure/functions on data tables. This to demonstrate my ability to used stored functions
Context 
For this task, imagine you are working as a credit analyst for a banks overdraft product as of August 2020. We are in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic and subsequent UK lockdown which has had an impact on the performance of Monzo’s overdraft portfolio. 
Goal 
You are asked to analyse the impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic on banks overdraft portfolio. We would like you to look into how the portfolio has changed as the UK was put into lockdown in March 2020 and what actions you think the business should take. 
Please create a short presentation of no more than 8 slides with key insights into the health of the portfolio and your recommendation for next steps. Please provide the presentation in PDF format and include the SQL queries used to perform your analysis with the PDF (this doesn’t count towards the 8 slides mentioned above). 



Data Tables 
You are given two data tables to help with this analysis, these contain some example data of Monzo’s overdraft portfolio: 
1. `accounts_sample` - A list of customers who have an overdraft enabled along with some key characteristics of them. 
2. `monthly_performance` - One row per customer per month with performance data on how they are using their overdraft between January 2020 and July 2020. 
Evaluation Criteria 
You will be evaluated on three dimensions: 
1. Analysis - Are your derived insights valid and do the metrics calculated make sense in the business context? Are you making fair comparisons and do you think about any potential biases? 
2. Communication - Do you present your findings in a clear and easily digestible manner? Do you give a clear recommendation of next steps? Please don’t focus too much on aesthetics, content and readability are more important for this task. 
3. Technical skills - Is the code you write correct, clear and efficient?
